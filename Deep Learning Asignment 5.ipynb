    "Splitting a data set creates more files, which occupy more disk space and forces more I/O operations. I/O and disk access is often the most expensive part of your SAS processing, performance-wise. But if the boss asks for broken-up data sets, you might as well spend the least possible effort on the task."

In this situation, the GPU will be partially idle while it waits for the CPU to pass in training data. This is an undesired state. Being that the GPU is, typically, the most expensive resource in the system, your goal should always be to maximize its utilization. "
