Sequential data includes text streams, audio clips, video clips, time-series data and etc. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a popular algorithm used in sequence models. Applications of Sequence Models 1. Speech recognition:In speech recognition, an audio clip is given as an input and then the model has to generate its text transcript."

The number of steps depicts the number of time steps/segments you will be feeding in one line of input of a batch of data that will be fed into the RNN."
